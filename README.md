BOFH - Bastard Operator From Hell.  1994-2024 as text. *absolute everything*


This is the entire series as one big 9 meg text file. Uploaded and is current as at the 12th June 2024.
Tens (Hundreds?) of hours have been spent over the years copying and pasting each and every episode into this single text file maserpiece, from various early websites until near fortnightly episodes were settled upon on ww.theregister.co.uk
I am confident that not a single episode has been missed within.

From an intro found at some point in time:

The semi-complete, gluten free, cold pressed and high fibre BOFH archives, torn straight from the Bastard's own jotter pad by the very forces of nature itself, now loving presented in a hard-to-see font by your favourite web renderer. I hope you like it so much you'll tell your friends about it. Maybe they'll like it so much they'll tell THEIR friends about it.
Maybe someone will send me money. Wouldn't that be great?

Hi, my name is Simon Travaglia and my favourite colour is blue. Or red.
I'm the author of Bastard Operator from Hell, amongst other lesser known things. To the left you'll find the annotated semi-complete Bastard Operator from Hell site in all its restructured glory... Below (if you haven't sent me money, and/or are not going to send me money) there's some favours you can do for me, and for yourself. 

 I live in Hautapu, New Zealand. There's not a lot out here apart from a Dairy Factory and a Cemetery. And my Chandler and Price 10x15 printing press.
